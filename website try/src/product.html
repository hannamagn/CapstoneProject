                    <p>Our goal with tiny trends is to help the user generate images that feels inspirational and relateble to people living in 
                    small living accomidations, in America.

                    After several interviews with Americans, we came to the conclusion that there is a lack of relateble images for people living 
                    in small spaces. Also, many thought that Ikeas website did not have product and styling images that felt like a typical american home. 
                    Because of this, we decided to set our focus on the target group that was not represented at Ikeas website: "Students and young adults 
                    who live in cities, small living spaces apartments or dorms". </p>
                    
                    <p> have choosen to focus on smaller accomendations, such as student doorm rooms and studio apartments. We formulated the problem
                    like this: "How can you make a digital tool that generates realistic and inspirational images of  small living and relaxing spaces 
                    in homes in big American cities, that is focusing on the target group “student/young adults who live in cities, small living spaces 
                    apartments/dorms”? </p> </div>
